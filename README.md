# Sketchpad
(Preface)
My Rock Paper Scissors project was somewhat of a disappointment. I was stuck and turned to tutorials for some help. I want this to be all of my code only, with the help of some research and Stack Overflow. This will be my best work, and if it takes a while then so be it, but I want to really test my skills. I will be making an Etch-a-Sketch using all of my knowledge on CSS, HTMl, and Javascript. I will update this file and the end and give my review of the project and of my work.
